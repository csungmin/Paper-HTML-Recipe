 <h1>ANOTHER COMPANION TO BOOKS FROM <br> THE SIMPSIONS <BR> IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER</h1>
    <h3>This book is a collection of the captured moments of the scene that contains books in the Simpsons animation.
        The book is the perfect binding-styled book and the overall colour usage of this book is bright yellow (Simpson yellow), each different shades of gray, black, and white.
        All the elements in the book are printed on yellow paper so the overall background colour of yellow. <br><br>

        I think the gestalt principle used in this book is "Proximity" because all the elements on the cover page of the book are divided into different sections making 
        the size of each text different and showing them as different types of information. Also, the title at the top looks like a grouped title, and the barcode and image
        at the bottom look like the group too. It makes readers easily divide the function of each text and image.

        <br><br>
        If I were the author, I would design the cover page horizontally. It was a little awkward when the cover page was the only vertically designed and all other pages are 
        horizontally designed. I would keep the idea of the "Proximity" principle by keeping different sizes of texts and boldness to divide the information clearly.
